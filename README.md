## Getting Started
## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to clone the repository, set up the Python environment, and run the chess engine:

1. *Clone the Repository*

   Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aayush-Kr-13/Chess-Engine-Python.git
   
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

   bash
    cd Chess-Engine-Python
   
   Create a new virtual environment using pyenv:
   bash
    pyenv virtualenv 3.12.0 chessify
   
3. *Configure pyenv*

   Add pyenv to your PATH and initialize it. You can add these lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):

   bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
